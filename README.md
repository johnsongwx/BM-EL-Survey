## Abstract

Biomedical entity linking aims to map biomedical mentions to nor- malized entities in a given Knowledge Base, e.g. the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). While entity linking tasks have been applied in journalism and social media and achieved great success, many more challenges remain to be overcome in the biomedical field. In this sur- vey, we categorize biomedical EL approaches into rule-based, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models based on the develop- ment of the modeling paradigm, and provide a comprehensive review of each approach. Specifically, we group the entity linking processes into four categories: joint entity recognition and linking, global entity linking, cross-lingual architectures, and model efficiency optimization. Moreover, we incorporate five commonly used biomedical entity linking datasets and provide performance analysis of entity linking methods over these datasets. Finally, we discuss the limitations of existing methods and highlight some promising future directions.
